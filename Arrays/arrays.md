# Array Notes

## Functions in Javascript:
- push (pushes element to element to last index (by default) in array)
- pop (pops last element (by default) in array)
- unshift (adds at beginning of array)
- lookup

**Let's ssay I have an array named strings:**

strings = ['a','b','c','d','e']

strings.pop -> ['a','b','c','d']

strings.unshift -> ['a','b','c','d']

strings.splice(start index, delete count, items to add);

## Static vs. Dynamic Arrays:

Static: Length doesn't change. Needs to be stated beforehand.
Dynamic: Length can dynamically be changed.modified
